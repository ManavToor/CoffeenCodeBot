<h1>Coffee n' Code Bot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Another discord server bot I made. This one was for a club I was a part of called coffee n' code. The bot was very simple, just greets people and asks what programming language they use to assign them a role.<br />
<br />
<b>This is my traffic junction. It includes:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Greets new users<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Asks user what language they program in and assignes them a role acordingnly<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-Hosted on Hikaruy<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-No longer in service :(<br /><br />
<br />
